#The class Dog() is Ã§alled in line 15 as if it were a function. 
#	The variable "my_dog" in line 15 is called an "INSTANCE" and
#	the value of input variables are called "ATTRIBUTES" of the
#	correponding instance, my_dog. 

#The "." notation, e.g. in line 18, calls on the ATTRIBUTES
#	in a similar manner to key-value pairs in a dictionary, 
#	with the exact calling form defined in lines 5 and 6.
